# Decentralized User Security Model

> A set of principles that a federated/decentralized system should provide to their users

--

1. Nothing is allowed, unless permitted (least privilege)
2. Permissions are granted only after the user confirms (user confirmation)
3. Identity is never exposed, unless permitted (explicit authentication)
3. Data is always private by default, no one has access to it or parts of it, unless permitted (explicit authorization)
5. No one can impersonate the user and operate in their behalf, unless permitted (explicit delegation)
4. Any intermediary, the host of the data or the network provider, if any, have no access to any data, unless permitted (encryption)
5. Shared data is only accessible by the parties involved (confidentiality)
6. Users must know if their data has been altered (integrity)

Asking for permission

7. User MUST be prompted when authenticating
8. User MUST be prompted when authorizing access
9. User MUST be prompted when delegating identity
